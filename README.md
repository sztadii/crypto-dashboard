## Description:
The UI dashboard to present useful information about crypto exchanges

## How to run the app
Please install `node manager` from `https://github.com/tj/n` <br>
Set up the node version ( specified in engines.node inside the package.json ) by running
```
n auto
```
After that you can install dependencies by running
```
npm install
```
Once you will download the dependencies then we can run the app by
```
npm start
```

## How to deploy the app
Vercel.app is handling the whole deployment. <br>
Each PR the Vercel is creating the link to the staging, <br>
so we can preview new changes ( which is awesome ^.^ ) <br>
If you want to look at the production, <br>
